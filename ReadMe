Attempt at building custom UI creation functions for HTML5 using jQuery and vanilla Javascript.

currently consists of:
	layout generator for num-columns and num-rows
	crappy navbar generator
	working on the makings of an organized list

notes:
	wasn't a fan of available JS UI available for html.
	use of .call() for appending to jQuery objects.
